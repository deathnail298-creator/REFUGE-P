# REFUGE-PREFUGE-P 

Rapid Emergency Field Underground Geologic Enclosure – Penetrator

Raccoon Note

This system is not intended for operation on Venus.

Any reports of “shinies on Venus” originating from the Planetary Science Division (PSD) are incorrect.

There are no shinies on Venus.

Overview

REFUGE-P is a passive, subsurface emergency refuge designed to provide a short-duration decision buffer (2–4 hours) for already-suited crew following catastrophic failure of surface or habitat systems. It exists solely to halt cascading failure long enough for evacuation, rescue coordination, or mission abort decisions to be made and executed.

REFUGE-P is not a habitat, shelter, or survivability extension system. Prolonged occupancy is treated as a failure condition. The system is intentionally limited, inert, and bounded to prevent mission dependency or misuse.

Operational Scope

REFUGE-P is applicable to airless or near-airless extraterrestrial environments, including the Moon, Mars, asteroids, and other small bodies. No environment-specific optimization or performance claims are made in Phase 0 or Phase 1.

REFUGE-P is assumed to be pre-emplaced via uncrewed kinetic penetrator deployment. Delivery systems, guidance, targeting, rescue operations, and mission planning are explicitly out of scope.

Phase Coverage

This repository intentionally stops at Phase 0 and Phase 1 only.

Phase 0 (Permission to Exist)

Phase 0 defines mission intent, boundaries, architecture, failure tolerance, assumptions, and success criteria. It establishes what REFUGE-P is and, more importantly, what it is not.

Phase 1 (Permission to Test)

Phase 1 defines bounded ground or analog testing to validate survivability, access, degraded usability, and failure limits. Phase 1 does not imply flight readiness or operational approval.

No Phase 2 or later development is included or implied.

Design Philosophy

REFUGE-P is designed to:

Be damaged and still usable

Function without power, life support, or software

Fail clearly and predictably

Resist reinterpretation as a habitat or shelter

REFUGE-P is not designed to:

Extend mission timelines

Improve comfort or endurance

Enable riskier operations

Serve as recoverable or reusable infrastructure

Licensing & Use

This repository documents a Phase-0 / Phase-1 system concept. Use, implementation, or incorporation into proposals or products is subject to the applicable license terms defined in the repository.

Plain-English Summary

REFUGE-P is a simple underground emergency refuge that gives suited astronauts a short amount of time to stop, communicate, and decide how to evacuate after something has gone badly wrong. It does not keep people alive long-term, does not replace habitats or vehicles, and is not meant to be stayed in. Its only job is to buy enough time to get out safely.
