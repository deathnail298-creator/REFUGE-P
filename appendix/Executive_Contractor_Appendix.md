# REFUGE-P (Hard Stop)
## Executive / Contractor Appendix

### Purpose

This appendix provides coarse, decision-level estimates for organizations evaluating whether REFUGE-P merits progression beyond Phase 1. These values are intentionally high-level and are not intended for budgeting, procurement, or contracting without further analysis.

No breakdowns are provided by design.

---

## Phase 1 to Commercialization Cost

**Estimated Cost:**  
$20M – $35M

This estimate represents the total additional investment required to progress from completed Phase 1 validation through a fieldable, mission-ready system, including engineering maturation, qualification testing, and production readiness.

---

## Phase 1 to Commercialization Time

**Estimated Time:**  
2–4 years

This estimate reflects conservative aerospace development timelines under safety-critical constraints and assumes no extraordinary schedule acceleration.

---

## Estimated Price per Fabricated Unit

**Estimated Unit Cost:**  
$2M – $4M per unit

This estimate reflects low-rate production of a passive, single-use emergency infrastructure asset and does not assume mass production economies of scale.

---

## Interpretation Guidance

These estimates are intended to support **go / no-go decisions only**. They do not represent commitments, quotes, or guaranteed outcomes and should not be interpreted as program bids or contractual offers.

### Plain-English Summary

Turning REFUGE-P into a real, usable system would likely cost a few tens of millions of dollars and take several years after Phase 1 testing. Each unit would cost a few million dollars to build and would be used only once in an emergency. These numbers are meant to help leaders decide whether the idea is worth pursuing further, not to plan a full program.
