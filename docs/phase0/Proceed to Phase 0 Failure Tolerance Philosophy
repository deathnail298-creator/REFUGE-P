# REFUGE-P (Hard Stop)
## Phase 0 — Failure Tolerance Philosophy

### Purpose

This section defines the damage, degradation, and abnormal conditions that REFUGE-P is explicitly designed to tolerate while still being considered functional. The intent is to align expectations with emergency-use reality and to prevent assumptions of pristine or nominal performance.

REFUGE-P is expected to be damaged. Continued usability under damage is a core design requirement.

---

## Core Failure Philosophy

REFUGE-P follows a degraded-but-usable philosophy.

The system is not required to remain upright, intact, comfortable, or fully accessible. It is only required to preserve a minimum survivable internal void volume and achievable crew access long enough to fulfill its 2–4 hour emergency decision-buffer role.

Failure tolerance is achieved through passive robustness rather than redundancy, active control, or correction mechanisms.

---

## Accepted Damage and Degradation Modes

REFUGE-P may remain functional under the following conditions:

### Structural Degradation
- External denting, buckling, or localized yielding  
- Loss of non-critical external material  
- Internal deformation that reduces usable volume without eliminating it  

### Emplacement Imperfection
- Off-nominal penetration depth  
- Significant tilt relative to vertical  
- Partial or asymmetric burial  
- Localized regolith or debris collapse  

### Access Degradation
- Increased force or effort required to gain entry  
- Reduced ease of exit due to deformation or burial  
- Partial obstruction that can be cleared by suited crew using hand tools  

### Environmental Exposure
- Extreme thermal gradients  
- Radiation levels consistent with subsurface shielding assumptions  
- Continued presence of surface hazards  

These conditions are treated as expected, not exceptional.

## Explicitly Unacceptable Failure Modes

REFUGE-P is considered failed if any of the following occur:

- Total loss of crew access to the internal volume  
- Collapse or deformation eliminating minimum survivable void space  
- Structural instability that risks progressive collapse during occupancy  
- Conditions requiring crew survival to depend on occupancy beyond the 2–4 hour design window  

These represent hard failure boundaries.

---

## Single-Point Failure Policy

REFUGE-P intentionally avoids single-point functional failures.

Accordingly:
- No active systems are required for protection  
- No powered actuation is required for access  
- No deployable structures are required post-emplacement  
- No software or control logic gates system function  

Any component that exists is assumed capable of failure and must fail benignly.

---

## Human-Centric Failure Acceptance

REFUGE-P assumes crew are operating under stress, with limited visibility and reduced dexterity. The system does not attempt to mitigate discomfort or disorientation beyond providing physical survival space.

Crew inconvenience is acceptable. Crew survival is the metric.

---

## Failure Versus Misuse

Prolonged occupancy, reliance on REFUGE-P for mission continuation, or use as a waiting shelter is considered misuse outside design intent, not a failure of the system.

REFUGE-P fails only when it cannot:
1. Be entered  
2. Preserve minimum usable internal volume  
3. Support short-duration suited occupancy  
4. Be exited for evacuation or recovery  

---

## Failure Philosophy Summary

REFUGE-P is successful if it works once, while damaged, under stress, and without assistance. Anything beyond that is out of scope.

---

### Plain-English Summary

REFUGE-P is designed to still work even if it is bent, buried, or damaged when it is placed in the ground. It only needs to keep a small space usable and reachable for a short time, not remain intact or comfortable. If people have to stay inside for long periods or cannot safely enter or exit, the system is considered failed.
