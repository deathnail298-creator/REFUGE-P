# REFUGE-P (Hard Stop)
## Phase 0 — Architecture Overview

### Purpose

This section defines the high-level physical architecture of REFUGE-P. It establishes what the system is, how it exists after emplacement, and which architectural characteristics are invariant across all Phase 0 and Phase 1 interpretations.

This section does not specify fabrication details, materials optimization, or flight-ready hardware.

---

## Architectural Summary

REFUGE-P is a passive, subsurface emergency refuge created through kinetic penetrator emplacement. The system consists of a structurally overbuilt penetrator body that forms a crush-survivable internal void beneath the surface.

The architecture prioritizes survivability, simplicity, and misuse resistance over performance, comfort, or endurance. REFUGE-P remains usable under imperfect placement, partial burial, tilt, and localized structural damage.

## Major Architectural Elements

### Penetrator Body

The penetrator body serves as both the delivery structure and the permanent load-bearing shell.

Key characteristics include:
- Monolithic, high-strength outer structure  
- Geometry favoring axial load paths and distributed stress  
- No reliance on deployable or articulated external components  
- Passive structural behavior without active control  

The penetrator body is expected to experience damage during emplacement and remains functional despite deformation.

---

### Internal Refuge Volume

The internal refuge volume is a fixed, enclosed void sized only for temporary suited occupancy.

Characteristics include:
- No pressure-retention requirement  
- No internal environmental control systems  
- Tolerance for partial volume loss due to deformation  

The internal volume exists solely to allow crew to physically occupy, stabilize, and communicate during the emergency decision window.

---

### Access Interface

REFUGE-P includes a single primary access interface designed for use by suited crew.

Characteristics include:
- Usability after burial, tilt, or surface disruption  
- No requirement for precision alignment  
- No powered actuation required  

Access simplicity and survivability are prioritized over sealing performance or ease of use.

---

### Structural Survivability Features

Survivability is achieved through passive architectural choices, including:
- Overbuilt geometry  
- Load-distributing internal shapes  
- Material selection favoring ductile failure modes  

No active shock absorption, isolation, or adaptive systems are required.

---

### External Identification and Recovery Features

REFUGE-P may include passive external features to support discovery and recovery, such as:
- Distinctive geometry  
- Surface markers  
- Interfaces for external locator systems  

These features do not provide power, communications, or self-rescue capability.

---

## Architectural Invariants

The following characteristics are non-negotiable for all Phase 0 and Phase 1 implementations:

- Passive operation only  
- No moving parts required for survival function  
- No life-support systems  
- No power generation or distribution  
- No pressurization requirement  
- No dependence on precise emplacement  
- No post-emplacement assembly or deployment  

Any deviation from these invariants requires explicit phase escalation.

---

## Architecture Boundary Statement

REFUGE-P is intentionally static and limited. Its value is derived from structural robustness and subsurface protection rather than system complexity or operational capability.

REFUGE-P is not designed to be upgraded, expanded, repurposed, or adapted for extended use. It is an endpoint, not a platform.

---

### Plain-English Summary

REFUGE-P is a strong underground structure that is placed into the ground and left there as emergency infrastructure. It protects a small internal space even if it is damaged, tilted, or partially buried. The design avoids power, moving parts, or life-support systems and relies entirely on strength and geometry to work once.
