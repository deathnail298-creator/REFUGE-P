## Phase 1 — Prototype Hardware Definition

### Purpose

This section defines exactly what physical hardware is permitted to be built and tested in Phase 1. The intent is to enable meaningful validation of Phase 0 assumptions while preventing premature optimization, flight-like interpretation, or scope expansion.

Phase 1 hardware consists of test articles only.

---

## Prototype Philosophy

Phase 1 hardware exists to:
- Fail visibly  
- Deform realistically  
- Be entered by suited humans  
- Bound survivability limits  

Phase 1 hardware does not exist to:
- Demonstrate manufacturability  
- Achieve mass efficiency  
- Resemble flight hardware  
- Support reuse or refurbishment  

If a feature does not support testing, it does not belong.

---

## Allowed Prototype Configurations

Phase 1 permits one or more of the following configurations as required to meet test objectives.

---

### 1. Structural Test Article

A structural test article may include:
- Full-scale or sub-scale penetrator body or section  
- Representative geometry and wall thickness  
- Materials selected for mechanical similarity rather than flight qualification  
- No internal outfitting beyond structural necessity  

This article is used to evaluate:
- Deformation behavior  
- Void preservation  
- Collapse and instability thresholds  

---

### 2. Human-Access Test Article

A human-access test article may include:
- Full-scale internal void geometry  
- A single primary access interface  
- Representative internal clearances  
- Passive internal features such as handholds or tie points  

This article is used to evaluate:
- Entry and exit achievability  
- Suited human movement and positioning  
- Usability under degraded conditions  

Structural fidelity may be simplified provided deformation behavior remains representative.

---

### 3. Combined Test Article (Optional)

A combined test article may integrate structural and access features if:
- Added complexity does not obscure failure modes  
- No additional systems are introduced  

Combined articles are optional and not required for Phase 1 completion.

---

## Required Prototype Characteristics

All Phase 1 hardware must adhere to the following:

- Passive operation only  
- Single primary access point  
- No life-support systems  
- No pressurization  
- No power generation or distribution  
- No avionics, software, or control logic  

Any deviation constitutes a scope expansion beyond Phase 1.

---

## Prohibited Prototype Features

The following are explicitly disallowed in Phase 1 hardware:

- Integrated power systems  
- Active seals or pressure-retaining interfaces  
- Environmental control systems  
- Comfort features such as seating or padding  
- Redundant access points intended for convenience  
- Precision emplacement aids  
- Any feature implying long-duration occupancy  

If it makes the space more pleasant, it does not belong.

---

## Materials and Fabrication Assumptions

- Materials may be commercial-grade or surrogate  
- Fabrication methods may be crude or non-scalable  
- Structural overbuild is acceptable  
- Surface finish and tolerances are non-critical  

Behavioral fidelity matters more than appearance or mass.

---

## Instrumentation Interfaces (Limited)

Phase 1 hardware may include:
- Attachment points for strain gauges or deformation markers  
- Temporary ports for test instrumentation  
- Non-invasive measurement aids  

Instrumentation must not:
- Alter structural behavior  
- Provide operational capability  
- Be required for system function  

Instrumentation damage does not invalidate the test.

---

## Prototype Ownership Boundary

Phase 1 prototypes:
- Are not flight articles  
- Are not reusable systems  
- Are not deliverable products  

They exist solely to support Phase 1 testing and may be destroyed during testing.

---

### Plain-English Summary

Phase 1 prototypes are simple test structures built only to see how the refuge behaves when damaged. They do not look like flight hardware and do not include power, life support, or comfort features. The goal is to learn where the design works and where it fails, not to build something finished.
