# REFUGE-P (Hard Stop)
## Phase 1 — Termination / Kill Criteria

### Purpose

This section defines the explicit conditions under which Phase 1 testing must be terminated. Termination criteria exist to prevent unsafe testing, eliminate non-informative experimentation, and ensure Phase 1 remains bounded to its stated objectives.

Termination is an expected and acceptable outcome of Phase 1.

---

## Immediate Termination Criteria (Hard Kill)

Phase 1 testing must be immediately terminated if any of the following conditions occur.

---

### 1. Loss of Access

- Suited crew cannot physically gain entry to the internal volume  
- Entry requires force, tools, or actions beyond reasonable human capability under emergency conditions  
- Structural deformation irreversibly blocks the sole access interface  

**Rationale:**  
If entry is impossible, REFUGE-P cannot fulfill its core function.

---

### 2. Loss of Minimum Survivable Void Volume

- Internal deformation eliminates the minimum volume required for suited occupancy  
- Progressive collapse is observed or predicted during occupancy  
- Structural instability presents imminent risk to crew  

**Rationale:**  
Preservation of usable void space is the primary architectural requirement.

---

### 3. Occupancy Requires Extended Duration Survival

- Crew survival depends on remaining inside beyond the defined 2–4 hour window  
- Continued occupancy becomes the only viable survival option  

**Rationale:**  
REFUGE-P is not an endurance system. Extended occupancy represents misuse or mission-level failure.

---

### 4. Catastrophic Structural Failure

- Uncontrolled collapse during testing  
- Structural behavior inconsistent with degraded-but-usable assumptions  
- Failure modes that cannot be bounded or predicted  

**Rationale:**  
Unbounded failure invalidates Phase 1 objectives.

---

## Conditional Termination Criteria (Soft Kill)

Phase 1 testing may be paused or terminated if the following occur.

---

### 5. Repeated Non-Informative Failures

- Test configurations repeatedly exceed obvious failure limits  
- Failures provide no new information  

**Rationale:**  
Testing exists to discover boundaries, not to destroy hardware without learning.

---

### 6. Assumption Violation

- Test conditions violate documented Phase 0 assumptions  
- Environmental or operational conditions fall outside defined scope  

**Rationale:**  
Invalid assumptions invalidate test relevance.

---

### 7. Instrumentation Dominance

- Instrumentation alters structural behavior or access outcomes  
- Sensor failure compromises test integrity  

**Rationale:**  
Observation must not interfere with function.

---

## Positive Termination Criteria (Early Success)

Phase 1 testing may conclude early if all of the following are demonstrated:

- Entry and exit are achievable under representative degraded conditions  
- Minimum survivable void volume is preserved  
- Occupancy is possible for the intended 2–4 hour window using suit systems alone  
- Failure boundaries are clearly identified  

Early termination for success does not imply optimization or endurance capability.

---

## Termination Authority

Termination authority rests with the designated test lead. Termination decisions are based on predefined criteria, not subjective confidence or optimism.

Continuation beyond a termination condition is prohibited.

---

## Termination Philosophy Summary

Phase 1 exists to find the edge of viability, not to push beyond it. When REFUGE-P stops being what it claims to be, testing stops.

---

### Plain-English Summary

Phase 1 testing stops immediately if people cannot get in, the internal space collapses, or survival would require staying longer than a few hours. Testing may also stop if assumptions are violated or nothing new is being learned. Ending tests early because limits are clearly understood is considered a success, not a failure.
