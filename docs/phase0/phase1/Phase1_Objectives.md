# REFUGE-P (Hard Stop)
## Phase 1 — Objectives

### Purpose of Phase 1

Phase 1 exists to validate the core Phase 0 assumptions under controlled ground-based or analog test conditions. Phase 1 does not establish flight readiness, operational approval, or mission integration.

Phase 1 answers a single question:

Can REFUGE-P still function as a 2–4 hour emergency decision buffer for suited crew after degraded emplacement and structural damage?

Anything beyond this question is out of scope.

## Phase 1 Primary Objectives

### 1. Structural Survivability Validation

Validate that the REFUGE-P architecture preserves a minimum usable internal void volume after representative damage.

Key outcomes:
- Demonstrate deformation modes that remain usable  
- Identify collapse or instability thresholds  
- Establish conservative bounds for degraded structural states  

Optimization is not required. Survival of the void is sufficient.

---

### 2. Access Achievability Validation

Validate that suited crew can physically enter and exit the refuge under degraded conditions.

Key outcomes:
- Entry and exit remain achievable after tilt, burial, or deformation  
- No powered assistance is required  
- Access failure thresholds are identified  

Ease of access is not a metric. Achievability is.

---

### 3. Degraded-Use Human Factors Validation

Validate that suited crew can physically occupy the refuge long enough to perform emergency decision-making tasks.

Key outcomes:
- Crew can enter and stabilize body position  
- Crew can maintain position without progressive collapse  
- Crew can communicate using suit systems  

Comfort, productivity, and endurance are explicitly excluded.

---

### 4. Time-Window Viability Validation (2–4 Hours)

Validate that the internal volume and passive protection do not force abandonment prior to the intended 2–4 hour window.

Key outcomes:
- No condition requires immediate exit for survival  
- No dependency exists on unclaimed REFUGE-P subsystems  
- Occupancy does not imply extended survivability  

The time window is validated, not stretched.

---

### 5. Failure Boundary Identification

Explicitly identify and document the conditions under which REFUGE-P stops functioning.

Key outcomes:
- Access loss thresholds  
- Void collapse thresholds  
- Structural instability conditions  

Failure discovery is considered a successful Phase 1 outcome.

---

## Explicit Phase 1 Non-Objectives

Phase 1 does not attempt to:

- Demonstrate flight or operational readiness  
- Validate delivery or penetrator guidance systems  
- Prove suitability for specific missions or bodies  
- Test atmospheric performance or pressure retention  
- Provide power, thermal control, or life support  
- Extend occupancy beyond 2–4 hours  
- Support unsuited crew  

Any test implying these outcomes is invalid for Phase 1.

---

## Phase 1 Success Definition

Phase 1 is successful if:
- The system can be damaged and still usable  
- Failure boundaries are clearly identified  
- Test results align with Phase 0 assumptions  

Phase 1 success does not require elegance, repeatability, or optimization.

---

### Plain-English Summary

Phase 1 testing checks whether the refuge still works after it has been damaged and placed imperfectly in the ground. The tests focus on whether astronauts in suits can get in, stay briefly, communicate, and get out within a few hours. Finding clear failure limits is just as important as finding conditions where it works.
