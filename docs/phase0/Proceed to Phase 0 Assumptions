# REFUGE-P (Hard Stop)
## Phase 0 — Assumptions

### Purpose

This section documents the explicit assumptions under which REFUGE-P is defined, evaluated, and validated in Phase 0 and Phase 1. These assumptions bound system scope, prevent implicit requirements, and ensure that downstream testing reflects the intended emergency-use context.

Scenarios that violate these assumptions are outside Phase 0 and Phase 1 scope and are not considered system failures.

---

## Crew Assumptions

- Crew are fully suited prior to entering REFUGE-P  
- Crew suits provide all required life-support, thermal regulation, power, and communications  
- Crew are trained for emergency response under degraded conditions  
- Crew are capable of basic physical actions under stress, including entry, stabilization, and exit  

REFUGE-P does not support unsuited crew and does not initiate suit-up procedures.

---

## Time Assumptions

- REFUGE-P is intended to support 2–4 hours of emergency occupancy  
- This window represents a decision and coordination period only  
- Prolonged occupancy beyond this window is neither assumed nor required  

Any scenario requiring survival beyond the defined window is treated as a mission-level failure, not a REFUGE-P deficiency.

---

## Mission State Assumptions

- A catastrophic system failure has already occurred  
- Normal operations are suspended  
- Mission posture is abort, evacuate, or recover  
- Use of REFUGE-P is rare, exceptional, and non-nominal  

REFUGE-P is not planned into routine mission timelines.

---

## Deployment and Emplacement Assumptions

- REFUGE-P is pre-emplaced prior to crewed operations  
- Emplacement is performed via uncrewed kinetic penetrator delivery  
- Emplacement accuracy is imperfect and not guaranteed  
- Structural damage during emplacement is expected  

Human-assisted emplacement or on-demand deployment during emergencies is not assumed.

---

## Environmental Assumptions

- Operational environments are airless or near-airless extraterrestrial bodies  
- Subsurface emplacement provides meaningful shielding from:
  - Radiation  
  - Thermal extremes  
  - Micrometeoroids  
  - Surface debris and hazards  

No Phase 0 or Phase 1 claims are made regarding atmospheric pressure management, active thermal control, or environment-specific optimization.

---

## Terrain and Geology Assumptions

- Surface and subsurface conditions are variable and non-ideal  
- Localized collapse, regolith flow, or debris intrusion is possible  
- Large voids, lava tubes, or engineered underground spaces are not assumed  

REFUGE-P does not rely on favorable geology to function.

---

## Access Assumptions

- At least one access path remains physically reachable after emplacement and failure  
- Crew may need to clear minor obstructions using hand tools  
- Entry and exit may require significant physical effort  

Ease of access is not guaranteed. Achievable access is the requirement.

---

## External Systems Assumptions

- Communications are provided by crew suits and/or external assets  
- Rescue, evacuation, and recovery systems are external to REFUGE-P  
- Mission control retains decision authority  

REFUGE-P does not coordinate or manage rescue operations.

---

## Assumption Enforcement

Phase 0 and Phase 1 validation activities are meaningful only if these assumptions hold. Violations require explicit scope escalation rather than reinterpretation of results.

### Plain-English Summary

REFUGE-P assumes astronauts are already in suits, have working life-support and communications, and are dealing with a serious emergency. The system is meant to be used for only a few hours after something has failed, not as part of normal operations. If conditions fall outside these assumptions, the situation is beyond what REFUGE-P is designed to handle.
