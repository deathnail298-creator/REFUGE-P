# REFUGE-P (Hard Stop)
## Phase 0 — System Boundaries & Ownership

### Purpose

This section defines the explicit responsibility boundaries of REFUGE-P. Its function is to prevent scope creep, eliminate ambiguity, and ensure REFUGE-P is not misinterpreted as a habitat, vehicle, or life-support system.

Any capability not explicitly owned by REFUGE-P is out of scope by default.

---

## Operational Domain

REFUGE-P is intended for use in airless or near-airless extraterrestrial environments where subsurface emplacement provides protection from radiation, thermal extremes, micrometeoroids, and surface hazards.

Representative domains include:
- The Moon  
- Mars  
- Asteroids and small bodies  

No environment-specific optimization, tuning, or performance claims are made in Phase 0 or Phase 1. Environmental adaptation, if any, is deferred to later phases and external systems.

---

## REFUGE-P System Ownership

REFUGE-P is responsible only for the following:

- A crush-survivable subsurface void volume  
- Structural integrity sufficient to preserve minimum usable internal space after emplacement upset  
- A single primary access interface usable by suited crew  
- Passive survivability derived from geometry and materials  
- Minimal internal physical features required for temporary occupancy (e.g., handholds, tie points)  
- Passive external identification or locator features to support discovery and recovery  

REFUGE-P ownership begins after emplacement and ends when the crew exits for evacuation or recovery.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope

REFUGE-P does not include, provide, or manage the following.

### Life Support and Crew Systems

- Oxygen supply  
- Carbon dioxide removal  
- Thermal regulation  
- Power generation or distribution  
- Lighting beyond passive or marking features  
- Food, water, hygiene, or waste management  
- Medical support or monitoring  

All crew survival functions are provided exclusively by crew suits.

---

### Delivery and Emplacement Systems

- Launch vehicles  
- Guidance, navigation, or control systems  
- Targeting or precision placement  
- Penetration dynamics optimization  
- Propulsion or attitude control  

REFUGE-P assumes emplacement via uncrewed kinetic delivery but does not own or specify the delivery system.

---

### Mission and Rescue Operations

- Failure detection or alarm systems  
- Crew decision-making authority  
- Evacuation planning or execution  
- Rescue vehicles or extraction hardware  
- Mission timeline management  

REFUGE-P is a passive endpoint and does not participate in mission control.

---

## Suit System Ownership

Crew suits are assumed to provide, at minimum:

- Full life-support functionality  
- Thermal regulation  
- Communications  
- Crew power  
- Emergency duration margins consistent with REFUGE-P’s 2–4 hour design window  

REFUGE-P does not supplement or replace any suit capability.

---

## Failure Boundary Definition

REFUGE-P is considered successful if:

- The crew can physically enter the refuge  
- A minimum protected void volume is preserved  
- Occupancy for the defined 2–4 hour window is possible using suit systems alone  
- The crew can exit for evacuation or recovery  

REFUGE-P is considered failed if:

- Access is not achievable  
- The internal volume collapses below usable limits  
- Prolonged occupancy is required for crew survival  

Prolonged occupancy is treated as misuse or mission-level failure, not intended operation.

---

## Boundary Enforcement

Any proposal to add systems, capabilities, or requirements beyond those defined above constitutes a scope expansion and requires explicit escalation beyond Phase 0 or Phase 1.

---

### Plain-English Summary

REFUGE-P only provides a strong underground space that astronauts in suits can enter briefly during an emergency. It does not supply air, power, heat, communications, or rescue capability, and it does not control how missions are run. Everything ne
