# REFUGE-P (Hard Stop)
## Phase 0 — Mission Definition & Non-Claims

### Mission Definition

REFUGE-P is a time-limited emergency refuge intended to provide a short-duration decision buffer for already-suited crew following catastrophic habitat or surface-system failure. Its sole purpose is to halt cascading failure, stabilize the crew, and enable orderly evacuation, rescue coordination, or mission abort decisions.

REFUGE-P is designed to provide 2–4 hours of protected refuge under worst-case emergency conditions. This time window is explicitly bounded and is not intended to support prolonged occupancy, continued operations, or mission continuation. Use of REFUGE-P indicates that a primary system failure has already occurred and that evacuation or recovery actions are in progress.

REFUGE-P is conceived as pre-emplaced emergency infrastructure delivered via an uncrewed kinetic penetrator deployment method. Human emplacement, manual insertion, or crew-assisted penetration is explicitly unsupported and out of scope.

REFUGE-P does not enable riskier missions, extended timelines, or operational flexibility. It exists solely to buy time to exit a failure state.

### Design Intent (“Hard Stop” Doctrine)

REFUGE-P is intentionally designed as a hard stop, not a shelter.

Prolonged occupancy is treated as a failure condition, not a success case. The system is not optimized for comfort, productivity, or endurance. Its value lies entirely in providing a brief, survivable pause in which decisions can be made and executed under extreme conditions.

### Explicit Non-Claims

REFUGE-P is not:

- A habitat, shelter, safe haven, or fallback living space  
- A secondary or auxiliary habitat  
- A long-duration refuge or survivability extension system  
- A pressurized volume or life-support system  
- A system intended for rest, sleep, work, hygiene, food preparation, or waste management  
- A mission-enabling or mission-extending asset  
- A replacement for primary habitats, vehicles, or evacuation systems  
- A rescue system or guaranteed survival mechanism  
- A lava-tube substitute or geological shelter guarantee  

REFUGE-P provides no life support beyond what is carried by the crew’s suits. Any interpretation of REFUGE-P as a place to wait out conditions, remain for extended periods, or continue mission activities is explicitly unsupported and out of scope.

---

### Scope Boundary Statement

REFUGE-P begins its functional responsibility after emplacement and ends when the crew exits to evacuate or is recovered. Delivery vehicles, guidance systems, targeting, propulsion, rescue operations, and mission planning decisions are external systems and are not owned by REFUGE-P.

---

### Plain-English Summary

REFUGE-P is an underground emergency refuge that gives suited astronauts a short amount of time to stop, communicate, and decide how to evacuate after a major system failure. It is not meant to be lived in or used for long periods, and staying inside longer than a few hours means something else has gone wrong. Its only role is to buy enough time to leave safely.
