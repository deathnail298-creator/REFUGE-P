# Phase 0 — Mission Definition & System Boundaries

## Problem Definition

Lunar surface operations generate persistent nuisance dust from routine activity such as crew movement, rover traffic, handling operations, and post-event drift. This dust remains mobile near the surface and accumulates in activity zones where it interferes with operations, maintenance, and downstream processing systems.

Existing mitigation approaches focus on suppression, cleaning, or active removal. These approaches introduce power demand, moving parts, sensors, and operational coupling that increase system complexity and failure modes.

The unresolved problem addressed here is whether already-airborne dust can be intercepted and contained using a passive, infrastructure-grade system that introduces no additional power, sensing, or operational dependencies.

## Phase 0 Objective

The Phase 0 objective is to establish that a passive dust interception and collection unit is physically plausible, clearly bounded, and suitable for fabrication without unresolved technical or programmatic dependencies.

Phase 0 does not seek to prove performance, efficiency, or operational value.

## System Overview

The GEMS Dust Capture & Feed Unit (DCF) is a static, always-open structure that intercepts dust already in motion and passively guides it into a gravity-fed hopper for manual transfer to downstream systems.

The system operates continuously with no power, sensors, software, control logic, or moving parts.

## Operating Assumptions

* Dust targeted by DCF is already airborne or in motion due to routine surface activity.
* Dust interception occurs near the surface in localized activity zones.
* Manual servicing by suited crew is available at low frequency.
* Downstream systems exist to receive, process, or dispose of collected dust.

## System Boundaries

DCF system boundaries are explicitly limited to:

* Passive dust interception geometry
* Gravity-fed dust collection hopper
* Manual handoff point for collected material

DCF excludes:

* Active dust generation control
* Dust suppression or plume mitigation
* Dust cleaning of surfaces, suits, or mechanisms
* Any powered behavior, sensing, automation, or feedback

## Functional Description

Dust already in motion encounters the always-open capture geometry. The geometry presents a preferential dead-end path that increases the likelihood of dust entering the structure rather than continuing along the surface.

Once inside the capture volume, dust settles under gravity into a hopper. No valves, flaps, or actuators regulate flow. Dust remains stored until manually removed.

## Interfaces and Ownership

DCF terminates at a manual dust handoff point. Ownership of all downstream requirements, including:

* Particle screening
* Purification or sterilization
* Metering or transport
* Storage or disposal

rests entirely with the downstream system.

## Environmental Considerations

* Operation is limited to airless or near-airless extraterrestrial environments.
* Thermal behavior is passive and dictated by material selection and geometry.
* Dust accumulation on external surfaces is not considered a failure mode.

## Non-Claims

DCF makes no claims regarding:

* Capture efficiency or throughput
* Particle size distribution or purity
* Reduction of dust creation rates
* Area cleanliness guarantees
* Hazard classification or certification

## Phase 0 Success Criteria

Phase 0 is considered successful if:

* Passive interception geometry is physically plausible
* Gravity-fed hopper behavior is credible without active elements
* System boundaries prevent scope creep and entanglement with downstream systems

No performance thresholds are defined at Phase 0.

## Plain-English Summary

This system is a passive structure that catches dust already moving across the surface and lets it settle into a container. It does not stop dust from being created or actively remove dust from the environment. Its purpose at this stage is only to show that such a simple structure can plausibly exist and be built.
