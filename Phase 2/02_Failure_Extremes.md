Failure Extremes — Phase 2
Purpose

This document explores extreme, low-probability, high-impact failure cases for the REFUGE-P (Hard Stop) concept.

These are not expected failures.
They are boundary failures that define where the concept stops being meaningful.

No mitigation is proposed.

Extreme 1: Complete Subsurface Collapse

Condition:
The penetrator creates an initial cavity that later collapses entirely due to geological instability.

Outcome:
The refuge volume ceases to exist. The system becomes irrecoverable dead mass with no detectable function.

Interpretation:
REFUGE-P provides zero benefit under this condition and must be treated as nonexistent.

Extreme 2: Partial Cavity With No Human-Usable Volume

Condition:
A void exists, but its geometry prevents human occupancy (pinched, jagged, obstructed).

Outcome:
The refuge cannot be entered or used. The presence of a cavity does not equate to refuge functionality.

Interpretation:
Structural existence does not imply operational existence.

Extreme 3: Entrance Obstruction or Misalignment

Condition:
The access path is blocked, buried, or rendered unreachable by terrain shift or debris.

Outcome:
The refuge is present but inaccessible. Emergency use is impossible.

Interpretation:
Accessibility is a binary condition; partial access is equivalent to failure.

Extreme 4: Human Injury During Entry

Condition:
Crew member is injured while attempting to reach or enter the refuge.

Outcome:
Entry attempt worsens the emergency. The refuge contributes to harm rather than mitigation.

Interpretation:
Emergency infrastructure can increase risk when accessed under degraded human conditions.

Extreme 5: Suit Failure Inside the Refuge

Condition:
A suit fails catastrophically while inside the refuge volume.

Outcome:
The refuge provides no compensating systems. Fatality is not prevented.

Interpretation:
REFUGE-P is not a life-support system and does not buffer suit failure.

Extreme 6: Psychological Misuse Under Duress

Condition:
Crew treats the refuge as a place to wait indefinitely rather than a decision buffer.

Outcome:
Time is consumed without planning or evacuation, reducing survival probability.

Interpretation:
Human behavior under stress can invert intended doctrine.

Extreme 7: Multiple Concurrent Failures

Condition:
Geological instability, access obstruction, and human impairment occur together.

Outcome:
The system fails completely with no partial value.

Interpretation:
Failure modes compound rather than average out.

Extreme 8: Post-Event Reinterpretation

Condition:
After survival of an incident, the refuge is reclassified as acceptable long-term shelter.

Outcome:
Future users rely on it beyond its design intent, increasing systemic risk.

Interpretation:
Doctrinal drift can be more dangerous than physical failure.

Observations

Across extreme cases:

Many failures are binary, not gradual

Several outcomes actively worsen risk

Human behavior is a dominant failure amplifier

The concept has sharp edges, not soft margins

These are not design flaws in Phase 2; they are truths to be acknowledged.

Plain-English Summary

This document looks at worst-case failures.
In many extremes, the refuge does nothing or makes things worse.
That’s the cost of a simple, passive emergency system.
