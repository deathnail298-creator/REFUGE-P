Theory Scope — Phase 2
Purpose

This document defines the allowed scope and hard boundaries of Phase 2 theory exploration for the REFUGE-P (Hard Stop) concept.

Phase 2 exists to support thinking, not doing.

Nothing in Phase 2 authorizes action.

What Phase 2 Allows

Phase 2 permits non-executing theory only, including:

Conceptual reasoning

Thought experiments

Constraint analysis

Edge-case exploration

Failure-mode reasoning

Comparative abstraction

Logical consistency checks

“What-if” exploration with no proposed remedies

All Phase 2 work is performed entirely in theory, without validation, testing, or simulation.

What Phase 2 Explicitly Forbids

Phase 2 does not allow:

Instructions, procedures, or steps

Dimensions, tolerances, or materials

Design refinement or optimization

Simulation, modeling, or emulation

Prototyping guidance

Test definitions or test criteria

Deployment concepts

Operational timelines

Risk mitigation plans

“Next step” recommendations

If a sentence answers “how would you do this?”, it does not belong in Phase 2.

No Bridge to Execution

Phase 2 is not a stepping stone to Phase 1.

Ideas explored here are intentionally non-actionable.

Any concept that appears to imply execution must be removed, reframed, or explicitly invalidated.

Phase Integrity Rule

Phase boundaries are structural, not aspirational.

Phase 0 defines permission to exist.

Phase 1 defines permission to test.

Phase 2 defines permission to think beyond testable bounds.

Phase 3 defines execution rights and commercialization, if any.

Phase 2 content cannot be reinterpreted as Phase 1 justification.

Theory Quality Standard

Phase 2 content may be:

Incomplete

Speculative

Incorrect

Internally inconsistent

Later disproven

Correctness is not required.

Clarity of boundaries is required.

Reader Responsibility

Phase 2 materials are provided to provoke reasoning, not confidence.

Readers are responsible for recognizing that:

No claims of feasibility are made

No safety assertions exist

No endorsement of use is implied

Misuse of Phase 2 material is a reader failure, not an author responsibility.

Enforcement

All Phase 2 materials are governed by the Theory Exploration License (TEL-1.0).

Execution without a separate execution license, defined in Phase 3, is prohibited.

Plain-English Summary

Phase 2 is for thinking only.
Nothing here tells you how to build, test, or deploy anything.
If an idea feels actionable, it does not belong in Phase 2.
