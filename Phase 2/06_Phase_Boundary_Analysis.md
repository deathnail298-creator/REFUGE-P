Phase Boundary Analysis — Phase 2
Purpose

This document explains why certain ideas are intentionally confined to Phase 2 and must not progress into Phase 1 or execution.

Phase boundaries exist to prevent conceptual reasoning from being mistaken for authorization.

Phase Definitions (Context)

Phase 0: Permission to exist

Phase 1: Permission to test (bounded, physical)

Phase 2: Permission to think beyond testable bounds

Phase 3: Execution rights and commercialization, if any

Phase 2 is deliberately disconnected from execution.

Why Phase 2 Cannot Transition Automatically

Ideas explored in Phase 2:

Lack verifiable assumptions

Depend on untestable conditions

Explore failure without remediation

Address edge cases, not norms

Operate beyond bounded prototypes

Transitioning such ideas into Phase 1 would falsely imply readiness.

Common Boundary Violations
Violation 1: “We Can Test This Part”

Claim:
A subset of Phase 2 reasoning can be isolated and tested.

Reality:
Removing context invalidates the reasoning. The test no longer represents the explored condition.

Violation 2: “This Is Just an Extension of Phase 1”

Claim:
Phase 2 is Phase 1 with more detail.

Reality:
Phase 2 often explores scenarios that cannot be safely or meaningfully tested.

Violation 3: “We Need Data to Close This Gap”

Claim:
Phase 2 uncertainty can be resolved with experiments.

Reality:
Many uncertainties are structural, not empirical.

Violation 4: “This Is Obvious, So We Can Skip Ahead”

Claim:
Some ideas are self-evident enough to justify execution.

Reality:
Self-evidence is not authorization.

REFUGE-P–Specific Boundary Constraints

For REFUGE-P, Phase 2 is locked because:

Extreme failure modes dominate outcomes

Human behavior outweighs mechanical reliability

Misinterpretation risk exceeds technical risk

Success encourages unsafe extrapolation

Testing does not meaningfully reduce these risks.

What Would Be Required to Cross the Boundary

Crossing from Phase 2 to Phase 1 would require:

Redefinition of mission intent

Rewriting non-claims

Acceptance of new liability classes

Introduction of active systems

Loss of “Hard Stop” doctrine

At that point, the concept is no longer REFUGE-P.

Boundary Enforcement Rule

If Phase 2 content:

Suggests a build path

Implies safety improvement

Offers mitigation strategies

Encourages validation

It violates Phase integrity and must be removed or rewritten.

Plain-English Summary

Phase 2 ideas stay in Phase 2 because testing them wouldn’t make things safer or clearer.
Moving them forward would give a false sense of readiness.
If something needs execution to make sense, it doesn’t belong here.
