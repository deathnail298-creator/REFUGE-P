Theory Kill Shots — Phase 2
Purpose

This document defines conditions under which the REFUGE-P (Hard Stop) concept should be abandoned, regardless of prior investment, interest, or institutional momentum.

These are non-negotiable failures.

No remediation is proposed.

Kill Shot 1: The Concept Is Treated as Life Support

Condition:
REFUGE-P is expected to preserve life independently of crew suits.

Why This Kills It:
The system is not designed to provide life support. Treating it as such creates false safety assumptions.

Kill Shot 2: Extended Occupancy Becomes Acceptable

Condition:
Use beyond the defined emergency window becomes tolerated or planned.

Why This Kills It:
The refuge becomes a habitat surrogate, inheriting risks it cannot manage.

Kill Shot 3: Presence Is Counted as Risk Reduction

Condition:
REFUGE-P is included in formal safety margins, redundancy calculations, or mission assurance metrics.

Why This Kills It:
Risk is shifted elsewhere under an assumption of protection that does not exist.

Kill Shot 4: Failure Intolerance Emerges

Condition:
Program leadership demands guaranteed performance or elimination of outright failure cases.

Why This Kills It:
The concept depends on accepting that some units will fail completely.

Kill Shot 5: Complexity Is Added to Increase Comfort or Confidence

Condition:
Features are added to improve usability, comfort, monitoring, or perceived safety.

Why This Kills It:
Complexity increases failure severity and undermines passive reliability.

Kill Shot 6: Human Behavior Is Assumed to Be Ideal

Condition:
Operational doctrine assumes perfect adherence under stress.

Why This Kills It:
The system must tolerate imperfect human behavior. If it cannot, it should not exist.

Kill Shot 7: Legal or Policy Reframing Overrides Intent

Condition:
Post-hoc interpretation reframes REFUGE-P as a safety guarantee or obligation.

Why This Kills It:
Legal expectations will exceed physical reality, making failure unacceptable.

Kill Shot 8: Success Is Used to Justify Expansion

Condition:
A successful emergency use is cited as evidence that broader use is safe.

Why This Kills It:
Single successes do not validate systemic reliability.

Kill Shot 9: Phase Boundaries Are Ignored

Condition:
Phase 2 material is used to justify testing, funding, or execution.

Why This Kills It:
That action violates the licensing and conceptual structure of the project.

Kill Shot 10: The System Stops Being Optional

Condition:
REFUGE-P becomes required infrastructure rather than a discretionary buffer.

Why This Kills It:
Mandatory dependence turns an emergency option into a single point of failure.

Final Assertion

If any kill shot condition is met, the correct response is termination, not redesign.

REFUGE-P is valuable only while its limits are respected.

Plain-English Summary

This file lists the reasons the idea should be killed outright.
If any of these happen, the system becomes dangerous instead of helpful.
Ending the project is the right move in those cases.
