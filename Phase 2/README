Phase 2 — Theory Exploration
Status

This repository section contains Phase 2 material for the REFUGE-P (Hard Stop) concept.

Phase 2 is theory exploration only.

No Phase 2 content authorizes, recommends, or implies physical execution, construction, testing, deployment, procurement, simulation, or operational use.

Purpose of Phase 2

Phase 2 exists to explore conceptual extensions, edge-case reasoning, and second-order implications that fall outside the strict bounds of Phase 0 (Permission to Exist) and Phase 1 (Permission to Test).

Specifically, Phase 2 may include:

Thought experiments

Constraint-based reasoning

Hypothetical failure chains

Abstract architectural variants

Comparative reasoning against adjacent concepts

“What-if” exploration that cannot be validated in Phase 1

All Phase 2 work is performed entirely in theory, without claiming feasibility, correctness, or readiness.

What Phase 2 Is Not

Phase 2 is not:

A continuation of Phase 1

A build plan

A test plan

A simulation plan

A roadmap

A prototype definition

A manufacturing concept

A mission proposal

An authorization to act

Phase 2 does not advance Technology Readiness Level (TRL).

Licensing and Execution Restrictions

All Phase 2 materials are governed by a theory-only license that explicitly prohibits execution without a separate execution license, defined in Phase 3.

Reading, discussion, critique, and internal reasoning are permitted.

Any form of execution — including but not limited to building, testing, simulating, modifying hardware, integrating into programs, or using Phase 2 material to justify action — is explicitly prohibited without a separate execution license.

The applicable license is TEL-1.0 (Theory Exploration License).

Relationship to Other Phases

Phase 0 defines mission intent, boundaries, non-claims, and permission to exist.

Phase 1 defines tightly bounded, real-world test permission.

Phase 2 explores ideas that are intentionally not allowed to progress into testing.

Phase 3 is the only phase where execution rights, commercialization, or paid licenses are defined.

Phase separation is intentional and enforced.

Reader Responsibility

Phase 2 content may be incomplete, incorrect, speculative, or invalid.

The reader is responsible for independent evaluation.

Nothing in this section should be treated as guidance, instruction, or endorsement.

Plain-English Summary

This folder contains theory-only exploration that is not allowed to be built or tested.
It exists to think through ideas, not to act on them.
If someone wants to execute anything derived from this material, that permission only exists in Phase 3 under a separate license.
