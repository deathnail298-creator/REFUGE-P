Phase 3 — Execution & Commercialization
Status

This section defines execution rights, commercialization rules, and licensing terms for the REFUGE-P (Hard Stop) concept.

Phase 3 is the only phase in which execution is permitted.

What Phase 3 Is

Phase 3 exists to:

Grant explicit permission to execute

Define commercial and non-commercial use

Establish legal boundaries

Set the execution gate

Phase 3 converts prior work into something that may be acted upon — but only under license.

Phase Relationship Summary

Phase 0: Permission to exist (concept definition)

Phase 1: Permission to test (bounded prototypes)

Phase 2: Permission to think (theory only, no execution)

Phase 3: Permission to execute

Nothing in Phase 0–2 authorizes execution on its own.

Execution License

Execution of REFUGE-P — in whole or in part — requires a Phase 3 Execution License.

Execution includes, but is not limited to:

Building or fabricating hardware

Prototyping or testing

Simulating behavior for validation

Deploying or operating systems

Integrating into missions, programs, or proposals

Using the concept to justify funding or procurement

Without a Phase 3 license, all execution remains prohibited.

License Overview

License Type: Phase 3 Execution License
License Fee: [repo-specific amount] (one-time)
Scope: Non-exclusive execution rights
Territory: Global
Duration: Perpetual for licensed execution

The license grants permission to execute.
It does not guarantee outcomes, performance, or safety.

What the License Includes

Right to execute REFUGE-P concepts

Access to Phase 0, Phase 1, and Phase 2 materials

Use of analysis, doctrine, and failure framing

Freedom to adapt execution details internally

Execution risk remains entirely with the licensee.

What the License Does Not Include

No performance guarantees

No survival guarantees

No mission assurance claims

No liability transfer

No obligation to support, certify, or defend execution

No exclusivity unless separately negotiated

Commercialization Definition

For the purposes of this project, commercialization includes:

Selling hardware or services derived from REFUGE-P

Including REFUGE-P in paid mission offerings

Using REFUGE-P in contracted programs

Incorporating REFUGE-P into proprietary systems

Using the concept to secure paid work, funding, or awards

Commercialization requires a Phase 3 Execution License.

What Is Not Commercialization

The following do not constitute commercialization on their own:

Reading or discussing the material

Internal education or review

Academic or conceptual analysis

Non-executing theory work

Reference or citation without execution

Execution is the trigger — not intent.

Risk Ownership

REFUGE-P is explicitly:

Not a habitat

Not life support

Not redundancy

Not a safety guarantee

By executing under Phase 3, the licensee accepts:

All operational risk

All human-factors risk

All legal and institutional risk

All misuse or reinterpretation risk

Why Phase 3 Exists

Emergency systems fail most often before hardware exists — during:

scope arguments

failure-tolerance debates

legal reinterpretation

institutional drift

Phase 3 replaces those costs with a clear execution gate.

Termination

Unauthorized execution automatically terminates any implied permissions.

Continued use after termination constitutes infringement.

Plain-English Summary

Phase 3 is where execution becomes legal.
A one-time license grants permission to build, test, or deploy REFUGE-P while keeping all execution risk with the licensee.
This replaces expensive early-phase reinvention with a clear, bounded execution decision.
