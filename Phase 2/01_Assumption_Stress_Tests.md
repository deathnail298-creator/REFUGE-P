Assumption Stress Tests — Phase 2
Purpose

This document stress-tests the core assumptions underlying the REFUGE-P (Hard Stop) concept.

The goal is not to solve failures, but to expose consequence when assumptions do not hold.

No mitigations are proposed.

Stress-Test Method

Each assumption is taken as false, degraded, or violated, and the resulting conceptual impact is described.

If an assumption fails and the concept collapses, that outcome is recorded without correction.

Assumption 1: The Refuge Volume Is Reachable

Assumption:
Crew can physically reach the refuge entrance within the intended emergency window.

Stress Case:
Debris, terrain shift, partial burial, or human injury prevents timely access.

Consequence:
REFUGE-P provides no functional benefit. The system fails silently and contributes nothing to survival outcome.

Assumption 2: The Internal Cavity Remains Intact

Assumption:
The penetrator creates a usable internal void after emplacement.

Stress Case:
Partial collapse, extreme compaction, fracture intrusion, or shape distortion reduces usable volume.

Consequence:
Refuge usability is reduced or eliminated. The concept degrades directly into dead mass with no recoverable function.

Assumption 3: Geological Conditions Are Within Expected Bounds

Assumption:
Subsurface material permits predictable penetration and cavity formation.

Stress Case:
Unexpected layering, voids, extreme hardness, or granular instability dominate.

Consequence:
Placement outcome becomes highly variable. REFUGE-P reliability collapses as a dependable emergency asset.

Assumption 4: Crew Remains Suit-Functional

Assumption:
Crew can remain in suits for the full refuge window.

Stress Case:
Suit damage, thermal overload, oxygen depletion, or physiological impairment occurs prior to or during refuge use.

Consequence:
The refuge offers no compensating life support. The system does not prevent fatal outcomes.

Assumption 5: Time Window Is Sufficient

Assumption:
The 2–4 hour window is adequate for decision-making and evacuation planning.

Stress Case:
External conditions evolve faster than expected or evacuation options are unavailable.

Consequence:
REFUGE-P delays failure without improving final outcome. Time gained does not translate into survivability.

Assumption 6: The Refuge Is Not Reinterpreted as a Habitat

Assumption:
Institutional users respect the “Hard Stop” doctrine.

Stress Case:
Operational pressure encourages longer occupancy, pressurization, or reuse.

Consequence:
The concept is misused beyond its structural and doctrinal limits, increasing risk rather than reducing it.

Assumption 7: Deployment Is Uncrewed and Pre-Positioned

Assumption:
REFUGE-P is emplaced in advance, without crew involvement.

Stress Case:
Deployment is delayed, rushed, or attempted with crew present.

Consequence:
Risk is shifted upstream. Emergency mitigation becomes emergency creation.

Assumption 8: Failure Is Acceptable

Assumption:
Stakeholders accept that some units will fail outright.

Stress Case:
Programmatic intolerance for failure leads to over-engineering or feature creep.

Consequence:
Simplicity erodes. The concept drifts toward complexity and loses its original value proposition.

Summary of Stress Results

Across stress cases:

REFUGE-P does not degrade gracefully in all modes

Several failures result in total loss of function

The system provides time, not safety

Misinterpretation poses a larger risk than mechanical failure

These outcomes are not corrected in Phase 2.

Plain-English Summary

This document assumes things go wrong and follows the consequences.
In many cases, the refuge simply fails or buys time without changing the outcome.
That is acceptable only if the limits are understood and respected.
