Comparative Archetypes — Phase 2
Purpose

This document compares REFUGE-P (Hard Stop) against adjacent emergency-shelter archetypes to clarify what it is — and what it is not.

No archetype is endorsed.
No selection is implied.

Comparison Frame

Archetypes are compared along these dimensions:

Deployment timing

Structural dependence

Complexity

Failure severity

Doctrinal risk

Emergency suitability

This is a conceptual comparison, not a design evaluation.

Archetype 1: Lava Tube Refuge

Description:
Use of naturally occurring subsurface voids as emergency shelter.

Strengths:

Large internal volume

Geological shielding

Potential for long-term use

Limitations:

Location-dependent

Access uncertainty

Assumes discovery and mapping

Contrast to REFUGE-P:
Lava tubes favor permanence; REFUGE-P favors availability.

Archetype 2: Surface Emergency Shelter

Description:
Hardened surface structures intended for short-term refuge.

Strengths:

Known access

Reusability

Easier inspection

Limitations:

Exposure to surface hazards

Structural vulnerability

Higher maintenance

Contrast to REFUGE-P:
Surface shelters trade survivability for accessibility.

Archetype 3: Mobile Refuge Vehicle

Description:
Rovers or mobile pods used as emergency shelters.

Strengths:

Relocatable

Controlled environment

Integrated systems

Limitations:

Mechanical complexity

Single-point failures

High maintenance burden

Contrast to REFUGE-P:
Mobility adds capability but multiplies failure modes.

Archetype 4: Buried Habitat Module

Description:
Pressurized subsurface habitats with full life support.

Strengths:

Long-term occupancy

Environmental control

Mission integration

Limitations:

High complexity

Catastrophic failure risk

Long deployment timelines

Contrast to REFUGE-P:
Habitats aim for comfort and continuity; REFUGE-P aims for time.

Archetype 5: Redundant Primary Habitat

Description:
Duplicate surface or subsurface habitats for backup.

Strengths:

Known interfaces

Operational familiarity

Planned redundancy

Limitations:

Cost and mass duplication

Shared failure modes

Doctrinal overconfidence

Contrast to REFUGE-P:
Redundancy assumes predictability; REFUGE-P assumes surprise.

Archetype 6: No Dedicated Refuge

Description:
Reliance on procedural response without physical refuge.

Strengths:

No infrastructure overhead

No maintenance

No false security

Limitations:

No buffer time

High reliance on perfect response

Contrast to REFUGE-P:
REFUGE-P exists only to add a buffer where none exists.

Positioning Summary

REFUGE-P occupies a narrow niche:

Minimal complexity

Minimal assumptions

Minimal guarantees

Minimal integration

It does not compete directly with habitats, shelters, or vehicles.

It exists where none of them are available.

Plain-English Summary

This document compares REFUGE-P to other shelter ideas.
Each option has strengths and weaknesses.
REFUGE-P is different because it only tries to buy time, not solve everything.
